- The lead female actor was able to foresee the future.
- It leaves all of us the think about is future fixed or it can be altered?
- Minority Report tally to tonight's speech in 2 ways,
  1. Literally, for my profession as a software programmer, making this report
  2. Based on the Umbrella scene, the female actor asked Tom Cruise to take an umbrella, when they're escaping from a mall, suddenly comes the rain. Umbrella blocked the eyesight of the ones chasing them. 

- When I develop applications, very often I encounter a situation I need some feature I didn't have before.
- It always comes to what if
  - What if we have some function like this or like that, we may solve this problem in an easy way   

- In a traditional style, I'm talking about more than 20 or 30 years ago, it's hard to have a creative imagination to let programs do abstract concepts.
- And it was not possible to do or to cooperate with something not yet invented

- Nowadays, software programs not just follow human being's step-by-step instructions. 
- It can also overpass human being's limits, like Alpha GO, totally destroy human being's last battle line as intelligent species.
- It's possible in near future AI will replace some job posts.
- As I know the first wave was finance related area.
- Another minority practice is Taichi practice
- Taichi and programming are something in common
  1. Both require multiple layers
  2. Both follow the philosophy: simple is the best
  3. The simple is on the top layer with a strong and very possible a complex foundation

- What is simple? Phone number
  1. It can be abstract to apply to all kinds of device
  2. Phone system eveloves countless times, the phone number remains
