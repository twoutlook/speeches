- The lead female actor was able to foresee the future.
- It leaves all of us the think about is future fixed or it can be altered?
- Minority Report tally to tonight's speech in 2 ways,
  1. Literally, for my profession as software programmer, making this report
  2. Based on the Umbrella scene, female actor asked Tom Cruise to take an umbrella, when they're escaping from a mall, suddenly comes the rain. Umbrella blocked the eyesight of the ones chasing them. 

- When I develop application, very often I encounter a situation I need some feature I didn't have before.
- It always come to what if
  - What if we have some function like this or like that, we may solve this problem in an easy way   

- In a traditonal style, I'm talking about more than 20 or 30 years ago, it's hard to have a creative imagination to let program to do abstract concept.
- And it was not possible to do or to cooperate with something not yet invented

- Nowaday, software program not just follow human being's step-by-step instruction. 
- It can also overpass human being's limit, like Alpha GO, totally destroy human being's last battle line as intelligent species.
